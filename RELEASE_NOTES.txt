TUTORIAL SKIP FIX
-----------------
Fixed issue where declining the tutorial ("No, I've played before") 
still showed the game overview/intro screen.

Now when user says they've played before:
- Tutorial is marked complete
- Intro screen is NOT shown
- "Show intro on start" setting is disabled
- User goes directly to the game

Users can always re-enable "Show intro on start" in the menu settings
if they want to see it in the future.
