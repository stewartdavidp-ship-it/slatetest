Slate v1.0.16
=============
Release Date: January 28, 2026

BUG FIX
-------
- Fixed wrong word clearing after game ends
  - When a wrong guess pushes score over 50, game ends and fills in answers
  - Previously, the 800ms "clear wrong word" timeout would run AFTER
    game end, wiping out the revealed answer on the row being edited
  - Now skips clearing if gameOver is already true
